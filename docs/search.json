Dargush\n\n\nComputers & Structures (IF: 4.4, acceptance rate 8%), vol.Â 299, pp.Â 107371, 2024\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis paper presents an innovative approach to developing and solving a dynamic topology optimization framework aimed at designing printable lattice (metamaterial) structures. By using a complementary-energy formulation and focusing on 2D metamaterials, the method efficiently accounts for dynamic behavior, enabling the creation of structures optimized for both static stiffness and dynamic performance. Numerical examples demonstrate printable, high-performing lattice topologies, highlighting the effectiveness of the complementary-energyâ€“based framework for manufacturing-ready metamaterials\n\n\n\n\nBibTeX\n\n\n@article{khawale2024efficient, title = {Efficient dynamic topology optimization of 2D metamaterials based on a complementary energy formulation}, author = {Raj Pradip Khawale and Suparno Bhattacharyya and Rahul Rai and Gary F.

The model utilizes a combination of seasonal decomposition and a recurrent neural network to predict expected values and flag significant deviations. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both accuracy and computational speed.\n\n\n\n\nBibTeX\n\n\n@inproceedings{ray2023realtime, title={Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Streaming Time-Series Data}, author={Ray, Alex and Your Name}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ICAI)}, year={2023} }"
