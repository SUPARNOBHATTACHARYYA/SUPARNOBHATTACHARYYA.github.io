### On some Theory, Theorems, and Scaling in AI for Science



::: {.abstract-section}
### Abstract

This talk presents a theory-driven view of AI for Science, focusing on how stability, error propagation, and scaling constrain learning in real physical systems. I will show how ideas from dynamical systems, random matrix theory, statistical physics, and spectral theory explain failure modes of large machine-learning models under long-time integration, and how autoregressive error scales with model size, compute, and prediction horizon. These insights yield diagnostics that predict long-term reliability without ground-truth labels and motivate scaling laws beyond brute-force parameter increase. The framework is illustrated on turbulence, ocean, and climate models, arguing that theory-guided scaling is essential for building trustworthy scientific machine learning. Bio: Ashesh is an Alfred. P. Sloan fellow and assistant professor in the department of applied mathematics at the University of California Santa Cruz. His interests lie at the intersection of theoretical deep learning, dynamical systems, and computational physics. Ashesh did his PhD from Rice University, Houston and spent a year at Xerox PARC and then at SRI as a staff research scientist before moving to UCSC.

### Walrus: A Large Physics Foundation Model for Fluid-Like Continuum Dynamics



::: {.abstract-section}
### Abstract

Foundation models have transformed machine learning for language and vision, but achieving comparable impact in physical simulation remains a challenge. Data heterogeneity and unstable long-term dynamics inhibit learning from sufficiently diverse dynamics, while varying resolutions and dimensionalities challenge efficient training on modern hardware. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we incorporate new approaches to mitigate these obstacles, including a harmonic-analysis-based stabilization method, load-balanced distributed 2D and 3D training strategies, and compute-adaptive tokenization. Using these tools, we develop Walrus, a transformer-based foundation model developed primarily for fluid-like continuum dynamics. Walrus is pretrained on nineteen diverse scenarios spanning astrophysics, geoscience, rheology, plasma physics, acoustics, and classical fluids. Experiments show that Walrus outperforms prior foundation models on both short and long term prediction horizons on downstream tasks and across the breadth of pretraining data, while ablation studies confirm the value of our contributions to forecast stability, training throughput, and transfer performance over conventional approaches.
