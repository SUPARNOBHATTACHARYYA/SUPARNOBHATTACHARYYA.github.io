Computers & Structures, 299, 107371. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruc.2024.107371\nAbstract\nAdditive manufacturing is revolutionizing hierarchical structure design with applications in compliant, auxetic, and band-gap structures. This paper presents a dynamic topology optimization framework for printable lattice structures aimed at reducing wave propagation within specific frequency bands. By using parametrically defined filament-based unit cells, bandgaps are tailored to mitigate resonance.\nOur method employs a complementary energy formulation to derive flexibility and stiffness matrices analytically, significantly reducing finite element discretization needs and enabling rapid exploration of meso-structures.\nHighlights: - New structural analysis technique for parametrically defined lattice structures. - Optimization speed increased by over 25x via complementary energy-based stiffness computations. - Achieved a &gt;250% increase in bandgap width within lattice structures.\n\n\n\nBhattacharyya, S., Cusumano, J. (Submitted). Model Reduction of a Piecewise Nonlinear Mechanical Oscillator. Proceedings of the Royal Society A. Preprint\nAbstract\nThis work explores model reduction of a hybrid nonlinear oscillator subjected to position-triggered electromagnetic kicks. We observed a range of bifurcation behaviorsâ€”both periodic and chaotic. Using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and an energy-closure criterion, we derived reduced-order models (ROMs) accurately capturing these dynamics.\nWatch on YouTube\n\n\n\nBhattacharyya, S., Cusumano, J.

We demonstrate how the energy closure criterion can be implemented experimentally to estimate ROM dimension using POD.\nUsing a periodically kicked Euler-Bernoulli beam, we developed a method for determining the ROM dimension based on convergence of system energy.

We find that variance-based mode selection may yield inaccurate ROMs under high impulsivity due to energy imbalance. Our proposed energy closure analysis offers a better strategy, resulting in more energetically consistent and accurate ROMs.\nSpotlight: This paper was nominated for an ASME spotlight presentation at the 2021 IDETC."
