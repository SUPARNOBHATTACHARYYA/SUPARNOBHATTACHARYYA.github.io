**Course:** Research Methodology  
**Level:** Postgraduate  

**Description:**  
This course (NMEC595 - Research Methodology and Statistics) introduces students to the fundamentals of scientific research, covering the entire research process from problem identification and hypothesis formulation to research design and execution. It emphasizes practical statistical tools including probability distributions, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, regression analysis, and sampling techniques necessary for data collection, analysis, and drawing meaningful conclusions from research data. The course also addresses critical aspects such as measurement scales, data presentation, report preparation, and ethical considerations like plagiarism in research.

**Course:** Finite Element Analyses Lab  
**Level:** Postgraduate  

**Description:**  
This lab course (NMEC535 - Finite Element Analyses Lab) provides hands-on training in developing algorithms and MATLAB codes for classical Finite Element Analysis of structural systems. Students learn to program various element types including linear and quadratic bar elements, plane trusses, plane frames, and Euler-Bernoulli beams for analyzing 1D, 2D, and 3D structures under static and dynamic loading conditions. The course emphasizes mesh convergence studies, error analysis, and culminates in a mini-project applying FEA to real-life structural problems.

**Course:** Mechanics for Engineers  
**Level:** Undergraduate  

**Description:**  
Mechanics for Engineers (NMEE101) introduces students to the principles of statics and dynamics, building a strong analytical foundation to tackle real-life engineering challenges. The course emphasizes solving equilibrium problems, analyzing forces and moments in structures, and understanding kinematics and kinetics of particles and rigid bodies. By the end, students will confidently apply mechanics concepts in a structured and logical manner to practical engineering problems.

**Workshop:** Dive into Reduced Order Modeling with pylibROM – April 2024  

**Description:**
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) is a computational strategy for approximating high-fidelity numerical models with significantly reduced computational cost. Instead of solving large-scale systems—often with millions of unknowns—ROM techniques construct low-dimensional surrogates that retain the dominant physics of the system, enabling efficient and repeated evaluations. In this workshop I demonstrate the use of popular open-source software called pylibrom, which was developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab, for performing model reduction of Large-scale FEA models.

**Workshop:** Principal Component analysis  

**Description:**
PCA reduces high-dimensional data into uncorrelated components that capture most variance, simplifying analysis and visualization. It is widely used in areas like image compression, genomics/population genetics, microbiome studies, atmospheric science, finance risk factors, feature preprocessing for ML, noise reduction, and visualization of clusters in 2D. This GitHub repo offers a comprehensive PCA introduction with intuition and practical examples for real datasets.
