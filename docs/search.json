Dargush\n\n\nComputers & Structures (IF: 4.4, acceptance rate 8%), vol.Â 299, pp.Â 107371, 2024\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis paper presents an innovative approach to developing and solving a dynamic topology optimization framework aimed at designing printable lattice (metamaterial) structures. By using a complementary-energy formulation and focusing on 2D metamaterials, the method efficiently accounts for dynamic behavior, enabling the creation of structures optimized for both static stiffness and dynamic performance. Numerical examples demonstrate printable, high-performing lattice topologies, highlighting the effectiveness of the complementary-energyâ€“based framework for manufacturing-ready metamaterials\n\n\n\n\nBibTeX\n\n\n@article{khawale2024efficient, title = {Efficient dynamic topology optimization of 2D metamaterials based on a complementary energy formulation}, author = {Raj Pradip Khawale and Suparno Bhattacharyya and Rahul Rai and Gary F.

Through vibration testing on a multi-degree-of-freedom structure, the authors demonstrate how carefully selected reduced-order representations can preserve system energy behavior. The results validate that energy-closure conditions accurately identify modal contributions and yield reliable reduced-order models for structural dynamics.\n\n\n\n\nBibTeX\n\n\n@article{bhattacharyya2022experimental, title = {Experimental Implementation of Energy Closure Analysis for Reduced Order Modeling}, author = {Suparno Bhattacharyya and Joseph P.

By employing an energy-based metric, the authors establish a systematic way to determine which system modes should be retained in a reduced-order model. Results for impulsively excited beams demonstrate that the method accurately preserves important dynamic and energetic behaviors while significantly cutting down on computational cost.\n\n\n\n\nBibTeX\n\n\n@article{bhattacharyya2021energy, title = {An Energy-Closure Criterion for Model Reduction of a Kicked Eulerâ€“Bernoulli Beam}, author = {Suparno Bhattacharyya and Joseph P.
