# Research Focus

My doctoral research centered on **model order reduction** of dynamical systems using **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)**. I developed a novel **physics-informed criterion** that accurately determined the dimension of reduced-order models, ensuring reliable representation for both linear and nonlinear **structural vibration systems**.

At **Clemson University**, I pursued postdoctoral research in:
- **Topology optimization** for bandgap maximization in 2D lattice structures  
- **Data-driven discovery** of structural vibration models using **neural ODEs**

Currently, I am a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at the **TAMIDS Digital Twin Lab**, working with:
- Dr. Jian Tao  
- Dr. Jean Ragusa  
- Dr. Eduardo Gildin  

My work focuses on **nonlinear reduced-order modeling** for complex systems.
